# qprob_devops
<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xenu256/QProb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xenu256/QProb)-->

qprob_devops is a proof-of-concept Django project intended to automate several things associated with  [QProb](https://github.com/xenu256/QProb) network of sites.

## Why?

One mouse click (preferably even less) is always better than running command line bash scripts. 
Ansible tower, Chef Manage, Semaphore, all that's great, but I think they're trying to grasp 
too much that further leads to micromamagement. This project is just micro-test to see how it works 
without overcomplications between different systems.

## Technologies

* [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython) 3.6+
* [Django](https://github.com/django/django) 1.11+

## Status

This idea can be easily expanded to manage everything, but 
at the current state it only does some small things.
